# Day 13 - part 2

## The bus schedule puzzle

### Notation

Consider $n$ buses with periods $T_i$ (**all prime numbers**) and delays $\delta_i$.
We are looking for $t$ such that
$$
t = u_1T_1 = u_2T_2 - \delta_2 = \ldots = u_nT_n - \delta_n\\
u_1, \ldots, u_n \in \mathbb N
$$

### With the first two buses

Let's consider the first two buses.
A time that satisfies the condition for both buses can be found by solving
$$
(E_1): \quad u_1T_1 = u_2T_2 - \delta_1
$$
The above is a Diophantine equation for which the existence of a solution
$(u_{1,2}, u_{1,2})$ is guaranteed by
BÃ©zout's identity since $T_1$ and $T_2$ are prime numbers.
The first time $t_{1, 2}$ that satisfies the condition reads:
$$
t_{1, 2} = u_{1,2}T_1
$$
And all the times satisfying the conditions are in the form
$$
t_{1, 2} = u_{1,2}T_1 + q_1\times\mathrm{ppcm}(T_1, T_2), \quad q_1 \in \mathbb N\\
 = u_{1,2}T_1 + q_1T_1T_2 = T_1(q_1T_2 + u_{1, 2})
$$

### With the other buses

By considering the time for which the condition is satisfied for bus $i=1$ and
all the other buses, we have
$$
t_1 = T_1(q_1T_2 + u_{1, 2}) = \ldots = T_1(q_nT_n + u_{1, n})
$$
So now we have to solve for
$$
q_1T_2 + u_{1, 2} = \ldots = q_nT_n + u_{1, n}
$$
and we're back to the initial problem with $(n-1)$ buses!

### Final solution

We can solve this recursively and the solution reads:
$$
t = T_1(T_2(T_3(...(T_{n-1}+u_{n-1,n})) + u_{2,3}) + u_{1,2})
$$
The above requires solving $n(n-1)/2$ Diophante equations.
